# Weather Forecasting & Risk Propagation 🌦️📈

An advanced predictive system that leverages Deep Learning and Graph Theory to forecast meteorological trends and simulate spatial risk across coastal nodes. This project moves beyond traditional linear modeling to provide actionable insights for urban and environmental planning.

## 🚀 Key Features

* 
**Time-Series Forecasting**: Optimized an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** network trained on **17,500+ hourly data points** to predict temperature and weather trends.


* 
**Non-Linear Modeling**: Outperformed traditional linear ARIMA models by capturing complex, non-linear dependencies in historical weather data.


* 
**Spatial Risk Propagation**: Simulated weather-related risk movement across coastal nodes using **Graph Theory**, creating a spatial model for disaster preparedness.


* 
**Data-Driven Insights**: Formulated actionable reports for infrastructure planning based on risk simulation results.



## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* 
**Language**: Python 


* 
**Deep Learning**: LSTM (Time-Series Analysis) 


* 
**Mathematical Framework**: Graph Theory (Spatial Risk Simulation) 


* **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas (Data Manipulation), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Visualization)

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. 
**Data Preprocessing**: Handling and normalizing a massive dataset of 17,500+ hourly meteorological records.


2. 
**Model Training**: Implementing and tuning an LSTM architecture to handle sequential weather data and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem inherent in standard RNNs.


3. 
**Benchmarking**: Comparative analysis against ARIMA models to validate the superior performance of Deep Learning in non-linear scenarios.


4. 
**Risk Simulation**: Mapping coastal regions as nodes in a graph and applying propagation algorithms to predict how weather anomalies move across different geographic points.



## 📈 Results

* Achieved high predictive accuracy for temperature trends compared to classical statistical methods.


* Generated a dynamic risk map that identifies vulnerable coastal nodes during extreme weather events.
